Hi, I’m Anna Ulitsky-Robson — a **strategist, builder, and connector** with a passion for turning ideas into lasting impact. My career began in International Law and Ethics, but curiosity and a drive for innovation led me to expand into business intelligence, organizational transformation, and brand development.

Over the past 15+ years, I’ve worked alongside startups, established enterprises, and community organizations — guiding them through growth, change, and opportunity. My work blends data-driven strategy with emotional intelligence, ensuring that solutions aren’t just effective on paper but resonate with people in real life.

I’m known for forging strong partnerships, reimagining systems, and designing educational tools that help leaders and teams thrive. Whether negotiating over a thousand agreements, building inclusive business systems that boost productivity by 150%, or launching community initiatives that unite people across industries, my focus is always the same: sustainable success built on trust, clarity, and shared purpose.

At the heart of my work is my personal code: Peace comes from within. I believe in aligning vision with values — and helping others do the same.
