##6 Things Your Business Can Learn from Quebec’s Jagged Justice System

Today started with a cold blast up the skirt of all that is ethical. I speak, of course of the Judge in Quebec who refused to hear a woman’s case because she wore a hijab.

A few things can be quickly learned from this case of ethical dilemma.

The most prevalent of points is that even a seated judge, or leader, needs a Code of Ethics.

So what can a great Code of Ethics do for your business?

*    It can help you manage your reputation
*    It can help you hire effectively
*    It can reduce the risk of overreaction
*    It gives you a great “go to” document for policy interpretation
*    It keeps your leadership team impartial
*    It helps manage the risk of discretionary power when supported by cultural competency terms of reference.

We can easily translate the issues of this news story to most business models.

We must arm our leadership with clear guidelines to avoid corruption of process. When adequately versed in an organization’s ethical foundation, leadership can without hesitation, adopt a “good steward” approach to ensuring the rights of all employees are considered and respected.

It is only then that the citizens of an organization can be their most productive and healthy. And we all know that productive and healthy means ka-ching on the profit line.

So wrap your organization in a fuzzy Code of Ethics based in Cultural Competency so your business is not left out in the cold.
