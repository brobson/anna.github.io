## 1:1 Leadership & Business Coaching

As a business leader, it’s easy to get caught in the whirlwind—constantly putting out fires, juggling priorities, and giving so much of yourself to your business that there’s nothing left for you.  

My coaching is designed to shift that. Together, we’ll build your confidence, your systems, and your strategies so that your business thrives **without you burning out in the process**.

You will:

* Develop **assertive communication skills**—clear, impactful, and confident—without aggression or force.
* Have **proactive strategies** to communicate effectively, positively, and with influence.
* Gain confidence that your business is **strong, self-sufficient, and stable**—even when you take time off.
* Transform your business into a **source of inspiration and pride**, not a draining obligation.
* Build a **trusted team** who has your back—and you’ll be glad to have theirs.
* Make decisions with **clarity and trust in yourself**, free from fear of disappointing others.
* Feel secure in **navigating growth, new markets, and innovation** with systems that can handle it.
* Confidently assess and integrate **new marketing models, platforms, and business tools**.
* Strengthen your **leadership skills** to foster both professional and personal relationships.
* Develop the ability to **choose collaborations and alliances** that truly support your goals.
* Manage **difficult conversations and complex situations** with confidence and less stress.
* Respond to life’s curveballs with **emotional steadiness and resilience**.
* Spend more time **creating growth opportunities** instead of reacting to crises.
* Align your business and personal life so you **protect your time, energy, and peace of mind**.
* Learn to **enjoy your business again**.

As Audre Lorde so powerfully said:  
> “There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle, because we do not live single-issue lives.”

## Coaching vs. Mentoring

When I’m **coaching**, I ask questions that help you uncover solutions you already hold within yourself. This approach gives you the space to articulate your thoughts, test ideas, and gain clarity.

When I’m **mentoring**, I share from my own experiences—offering perspectives, lessons, and strategies that have worked in similar situations.

Depending on your needs, we may work in one mode or blend both.

## How We Work Together

We’ll start with a free introductory call—either in person or via video—to discuss your goals, challenges, and get a sense for whether we’re a good fit.

If we move forward, we’ll typically meet for one hour every two weeks. This cadence gives you time to process our sessions, put strategies into action, and gather feedback. The schedule is flexible—we’ll tailor it to your pace and priorities.

We can focus on:
* Long-term strategic challenges
* Immediate pressing issues
* Upcoming transitions or opportunities

## Who I Am

I bring 15+ years of experience in leadership, strategy, and organizational growth—working with founders, executives, and leadership teams to align vision, systems, and people.  

My work blends **business intelligence, emotional intelligence, and practical strategy** so you can make decisions with confidence and clarity.

## Team & Department Mentoring

Sometimes challenges extend beyond the individual—spanning teams, departments, or the whole organization. In these cases, I facilitate **group mentoring sessions** to address communication, collaboration, and process alignment.

Sessions typically run up to two hours and can be preceded by confidential feedback gathering from participants, so we have a clear picture of where to focus.
